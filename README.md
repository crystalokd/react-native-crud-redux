# react-native-crud-redux
react-native-Quotes app

A basic React Native app that uses Redux to display information stored in the Redux store, our data was stored in a json file that was accessed every time the getData function is called. It's a Quotes app, that allows the user to add, view, update and delete quotes, in order to achieve this, I added CRUD operations.
